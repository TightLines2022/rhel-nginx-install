NGINX install script
by Dana Gray
ver. 1.00

This is script that easily installs Nginx on RHEL 9.0. The accompanying files are used to insert the 
desired IP's for the servers that are to be load balanced. They can possibly be used to add other configuration 
parameters as these will be inserted into the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file during deployment
